            An absence of color. Pure, undistilled white flour that symbolizes
            freedom, enlightenment... and futility. When magic first blessed
            these lands, Mystic Flour Cookie was revered as a saint—capable of
            granting wishes both big and small. Yet, as the crowds faded away,
            she was left with only apathy. Her once radiant light tarnished,
            leading her to join forces with the fallen Beast Cookies. Despite
            everything, Mystic Flour Cookie neither feels anger nor sadness, as
            wishes are nothing but mere illusions, and all worldly desires are
            destined to disappear one day. A world of nothingness. A world where
            every Cookie is liberated from burden. That is the perfect world she
            envisions. Once reaching that enlightenment, one shall open their
            eyes to the blinding truth: Apathy.

            While the losers are doomed to be swallowed whole by the Tide of
            Change, victors bend it to their will! Once known as the Herald of
            Change, Burning Spice Cookie shaped the course of history, when
            history itself was young. He was hailed as a hero, a leader who
            fought battle after battle to protect the faint light of
            civilization shining amidst the gloom. But as time marched on and
            kingdoms rose and fell in an endless cycle, he grew weary—bored by
            the monotony of it all. In his heart, the seeds of destruction began
            to take root. His name, once celebrated, was replaced by whispers of
            the Great Destroyer. But empty praises and worship from Cookies
            meant nothing to him, as only destruction could make his jam boil!
            During his long confinement, he cursed the chains that bound him,
            aching to unleash chaos. But now, Burning Spice Cookie is free,
            unchained, and ready to carve a path of havoc. The world will
            tremble as the Great Destroyer rises once more... and nothing will
            be spared.
