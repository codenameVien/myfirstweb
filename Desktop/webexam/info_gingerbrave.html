            Shyness can be quite advantageous. Why? Strawberry Cookie contains
            no real strawberries, only the flavoring. Were she as active and
            energetic as other Cookies, her artificial strawberry fragrance
            would have worn off in no time! Strawberry Cookie feels so ashamed
            of her main ingredient, she'd never want the truth to come out. If
            only she understood that this yummy strawberry scent is one of the
            many reasons other Cookies love her!

            Chili Pepper Cookie's dough contained much more chili pepper than
            allowed by the law. This is probably why she doesn't care much about
            rules at all! Chili Pepper Cookie is a notorious treasure hunter.
            She never misses a chance to snatch everything valuable she can get
            her hands on, leaving only chaos and havoc behind. The Cookies know
            better than to cross her path, and so should you. Good news: you can
            easily identify this path by a trail of fiery red chili sau

            Even before the custard on his head started to take shape, this
            little Cookie dreamed of becoming a glorious king, worthy of the
            title borne by the greatest rulers of the past. Custard Cookie III,
            as he prefers to call himself, may not rule anything yet, but
            looking at how active he is at waving his scepter and giving orders,
            it is only a matter of time before he sits on a real throne. And his
            determination is remarkable! Made of simple colored paper, his royal
            regalia looked so realistic that even the notorious Chili Pepper
            Cookie Chili Pepper Cookie got confused once! These days, Custard
            Cookie III is busy recruiting supporters to witness his future
            crowning. Perhaps you could become one of them?
